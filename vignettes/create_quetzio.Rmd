Package **shiny.quetzio** provides a relatively simple but also highly
customizable framework for creation and deploying questionnaire as a part
of your *shinyApp*.

Every questionnaire created in this framework takes a form of object of class
**quetzio_server**, and needs to be called inside the *server* of your application.

This vignette is going to take you on all basic things you should know about using
this package to include a questionnaire within your application - how to
build your configuration file, what are the core possibilities of **quetzio_server**
both as an semi-independent object and as a part of more complex logic in
your application.

## What is the **quetzio_server**?

It is main element of the whole functionality of **shiny.quetzio**. Its the 
*R6* class definition used to create objects creating Shiny modules upon
initialization. It takes a source of the questions (and optionally: additional instruction 
and descriptions for individual inputs) and generates the whole questionnaire UI. 
Within the created module the entire backend for the reactivity is contained 
(consisting of answers validation and their output).

Generally, the basic dataflow within this process is shown in figure below.

```{r quetzio_server_logic, echo=F, fig.cap="Logic of quetzio_server object", out.width='600px'}
knitr::include_graphics("quetzio_server_logic.png")
```

## What is the structure of question source?

As seen on the figure above, there are three possible sources for the questions:
- googlesheets (needs **googlesheets4** package installed)
- yaml (needs **yaml** package installed)
- R object (*list* or *data.frame*)

Only one source method can be used. It needs to be defined during initialization
by specifying `source_method` argument in the call of `quetzio_server$new()`

In the source, for every *shinyInput* you can specify following parameters:

- **inputId**
- **type**
- **label**
- mandatory: (true/false) if the input must be filled
- width: the same as in regular input specification. If not provided, defaults to 500px

>**Bold** ones are mandatory!

Additionally, various supported shinyInput types support additional parameters.
Table of the supported shinyInputs with all possible parameters is provided below:

|    parameter   |  textInput |numericInput|selectizeInput|radioButtons|
|    :----:      |   :----:   |   :----:   |    :----:    |   :----:   |
|placeholder     |      x     |     x      |              |            |    
|value           |            |     x      |              |            |    
|min             |            |     x      |              |            |    
|max             |            |     x      |              |            |    
|step            |            |     x      |              |            |    
|*choices*       |            |            |     **x**    |    **x**   |    
|*choiceValues*  |            |            |     **x**    |    **x**   |    
|*choiceNames*   |            |            |     **x**    |    **x**   |    
|maxItems        |            |            |       x      |            |    
|selected        |            |            |       x      |      x     |    
|inline          |            |            |              |      x     |   

> - *Italic* parameters are interchangeable. You can specify either *choices* or both *choiceValues* and *choiceNames* for single input. They are also multiple-value parameters.
> - Bold **x** indicates that the parameter is mandatory and need to be specified for given *shinyInput*

### YAML source method (`source_method == 'yaml'`)

The main intended way of sourcing data for the module is by creating a *YAML*
source file in a very simple form - template shown below. It also requires 
installation of the *yaml* R package

```{yaml, yaml_template, eval=F}
inputId_1:
   type: shinyInput_type
   label: shinyInput_label
   parameter_1: value
   parameter_2: value
   parameter_n: value
inputId_2:
   type: shinyInput_type
   label: shinyInput_label
   parameter: value
   multi-value_parameter:
     - value_1
     - value_2
     - value_n
inputId_n: ...
```

>inputId don't need to be specified as a parameter, but need to be provided
as the name of the sequence

### googlesheets source method (`source_method == 'gsheet'`)

Additional way of sourcing data, especially useful if you intend to frequently 
update the questions or there will be multiple people collaborating during the
run of the Shiny application.

To use this method the *googlesheets4* R package needs to be installed.

You can create example googlesheet using helper function provided with the 
package. It makes sure that all needed columns are present and they are containing
correct classes. 

```{r create_googlesheets_source, message=F}
# assignement to hold the ID of created googlesheet
id <- create_quetzio_source(
  method = "gsheet")

# see the data structure:
str(
  googlesheets4::read_sheet(ss = id, sheet = "Questions")
  )

# I remove the googlesheet created for this presentation
googledrive::drive_trash(id)
```

As you can see, it contains one placeholder row with exemplary values and
correct types. You can populate the *googlesheet* using Google Drive GUI - 
remember to remove the placeholder row!

>Values of multi-values parameters need to be separated within one cell with
either a semicolon or newline

### providing R object as a source (`source_method == 'raw'`)

If, for any reason you can't or won't install *yaml* or *googlesheets4* packages
or just prefer assigning the created R object as a source, you can provide
either a list or data.frame during initialization of new *quetzio_server* object.

They are analogous to the structure of *yaml* (list) or *googlesheet* (data.frame)
source file. You can check the correct structure for the same two-item example 
questionnaire configured in both list and data.frame below.

```{r raw_sources}
# every nested list need to be named with the inputId
list_source <- list(
  textItem = list(
    type = "textInput",
    label = "First input",
    placeholder = "Write inside of me, please!"),
  selectizeItem = list(
    type = "selectizeInput",
    label = "Choose up to two",
    choices = c("I am first", "I am second", "I am third", "Who am I?"),
    maxItems = 2,
    mandatory = TRUE
  )
)

# data.frame can be configured explicitly by 'data.frame'
df_source <- data.frame(
  inputId = c("textItem", "selectizeItem"),
  type = c("textInput", "selectizeInput"),
  mandatory = c(NA, TRUE),
  label = c("First input", "Choose up to two"),
  chrnum_placeholder = c("Write inside of me, please!", NA),
  mult_choices = c(NA, "I am first;I am second;I am third;Who am I?"),
  select_maxItems = c(NA, 2)
)

# You can also use the same function as for googlesheet generation to generate
# example data.frame with placeholder row, though you need to modify it
# afterwards

df_source2 <- create_quetzio_source(method = "df")
str(df_source2)
```

>The list is recommended for source, though with long questionnaires and
>similiar shinyInput types the data.frame source can be easier to generate - 
>it all depends on your workflow and the structure of the questionnaire

## Embedding the questionnaire in your shinyApp

If you have your source created correctly, it is the time to embed the
questionnaire in your Shiny application. You need to make some calls
both in the *server* and in the *ui* parts of your application.

### Generation of the quetzio_server object

You need to create the **quetzio_server** object inside of your *server* code.
There are following mandatory arguments for the `quetzio_server$new()`

- source_method: to choose the source method ('yaml', 'gsheet', 'raw')
  - for `source_method == 'yaml'`: **source_yaml**
  - for `source_method == 'gsheet'`: **source_gsheet_id** and **source_gsheet_sheetname**
  - for `source_method == 'raw'`: **source_object**
- module_id: character string to reference created module

So to create the questionnaire based on the source created above:

```{r quetzio_server_code, eval=F}
quetzio_from_list <- quetzio_server$new(
  source_method = "raw",
  source_object = list_source,
  module_id = "my_questionnaire"
)
```

### Adding the questionnaire to you UI

The questionnaire isn't seen anywhere in the UI yet! You can show it by
adding in your UI the following call:

```{r quetzio_ui_code, eval = F}
quetzio_UI(module_id = "my_questionnaire")
```

Yes - this is all!

> Remember that all shiny modules IDs needs to be unique withing your application
environement!

### Using the built-in googlesheets output method

If you wish to send the results of the survey automatically to some *googlesheet*
file, you can specify additional arguments in the **quetzio_server$new()**.

```{r quetzio_gsheet_output_server, eval = F}
# the same questionnaire as above
quetzio_server$new(
  source_method = "raw",
  source_object = list_source,
  module_id = "my_questionnaire",
  # but with specific arguments for the googlesheet output
  output_gsheet = TRUE,
  output_gsheet_id = "your_googlesheet_id",
  output_gsheet_sheetname = "sheet_name"
)
```

> As you can see above, the assignement of the object isn't necessary. It don't
allow for reading the state of the questionnaire or getting the asnwers in the
application. In the example above, the answers will be saved in the external
*googlesheet*, so the answer reading won't be necessary.

### Reading the state of the created quetzio_server object within the application.

You can get some information from your questionnaire by calling the following
calls on your object:

```{r, eval=F}
# All of the above are 'reactiveVal' object, so they need to be 
# accessed in the observe() or reactive() context
observe({
  
  # is the questionnaire done: TRUE or FALSE
  my_questionnaire$is_done()

  # check if there are any warning messages: if none, then NULL
  my_questionnaire$message()

  # get the list of answers. If questionnaire isn't done, then NULL
  my_questionnaire$answers()
})
```

## Adding instructions and/or item descriptions (optional)

One of the optional features of the **quetzio_server** is the ability to generate
multi-paragraph instructions and item descriptions for you questionnaire.

For elements of instruction and/or item description you need to provide correct
config, describing following element *types*:

- for instruction
  - **instruction_title**: generates *h1* tag of class **quetzio_title**
  - **instruction_para**: generates *p* tag of class **quetzio_paragraph**
  - **instruction_list**: generates *ul* or *ol* tag of class **quetzio_list**
  - all elements are pasted together in the given order within *div* of css class
  **quetzio_instruction**. It will be located just before the first question.
- for descriptions
  - **item_desc**: generates item description, which will appear between item
  label and input
  - it will be contained within *div* of css class **quetzio_description**

Following parameters can be provided to these element (with some mandatory!):

- *content*: the whole content of the given element
  - **mandatory**
  - for every element type
- *align*: how the *content* should be aligned withing its container
  - optional: if not specified, the default is 'left'
  - for every element type
- *html*: are there any HTML tags specified in the *text* 
  - optional: if not specified, the default is FALSE
  - for every element type but *instruction_list*
- *order*: should the list be ordered
  - optional: if not specified, the default is FALSE
  - for *instruction_list* only
- *inputId*: for which inputId it should be generated
  - **mandatory**, but only for *item_desc*

### YAML source

Needs the *yaml* R package to be installed, and should be passed to *desc_yaml*
argument during initialization of *quetzio_server* object.

Its form is similiar to the one of the YAML question source, but the sequences don't
need to be named:

```{yaml, eval = F}
-
  type: some_element_type
  content: content_of_element
  additional_parameter: value
-
  type: type_of_second_element
  content: content_of_second
  parameter_1: value
  parameter_n: value
```

### googlesheet source

Needs the *googlesheet4* R package to be installed. The googlesheet id
need to be passed to *desc_gsheet_id*, and sheetname to *desc_gsheet_sheetname*
arguments during initialization of *quetzio_server* object.

Its form is very similar to the one of the googlesheet question source. It can
also be created with helper function.

```{r create_googlesheets_deesc_source, message=F}
# assignement to hold the ID of created googlesheet
id <- create_desc_source(
  method = "gsheet")

# see the data structure:
str(
  googlesheets4::read_sheet(ss = id, sheet = "Descriptions")
  )

# I remove the googlesheet created for this presentation
googledrive::drive_trash(id)
```

### R object as a source 

Analogous to R object as the source of questions, you can provide them in the
form of list or dataframe. You should then pass that object to *desc_object*
argument during *quetzio_server* initialization:

```{r raw_descs}
# nested list don't need to be named!
list_source <- list(
  list(
    type = "instruction_title",
    content = "I am the <b>title</b> of this <i>questionnaire</i>",
    html = TRUE,
    align = "center"),
  list(
    type = "instruction_list",
    content = c("I am first", "I am second", "I am third", "Who am I?"),
    order = TRUE
  )
)

# data.frame can be configured explicitly by 'data.frame'
df_source <- data.frame(
  type = c("instruction_title", "instruction_list"),
  content = c("I am the <b>title</b> of this <i>questionnaire</i>",
           "I am first;I am second;I am third;Who am I?"),
  html = c(TRUE, NA),
  align = c("center", NA),
  order = c(NA, TRUE)
)

# You can also use the same function as for googlesheet generation to generate
# example data.frame with placeholder row, though you need to modify it
# afterwards

df_source2 <- create_desc_source(method = "df")
str(df_source2)
```

## Additional features

There are even more features that are out of the scope of this vignette. For more
information check other vignettes and help files.

- Functional features
  - get answers in form of data.frame with **get_answers_df** method
  - update item labels based on some *reactiveVal* with **update_labels** method
  - link multiple **quetzio_server** objects with **quetzio_link_server** object
- Customizable features
  - add your own submit button labels
  - add custom css to alternate the look of invalid input label highlight and
  mandatory stars
  - use specific div id to customize css styles more easily

## Alternatives to shiny.quetzio

I feel like it needs to be stated that **shiny.quetzio** isn't your only option for
creating questionnaires with Shiny. The main alternative is 
[**shinysurveys** package](https://github.com/jdtrat/shinysurveys){target=_blank}.

Main difference between these are the embedding - while **shiny.quetzio** can be used
to create questionnaire (or multiple of them) within more complex Shiny application, 
the **shinysurverys** are tailored to create whole ShinyApp by itself. It also
currently (as of 0.2.0.) doesn't offer built-in support of **googlesheets4**, 
either for source nor data collection.
